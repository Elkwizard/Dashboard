# Spartronics 2017-Dashboard

Repository with the Spartronics code for the Dashboard for
FRC 2017-STEAMWorks game. This dashboard is built atop the python
implementation of networktables.  Coupled with standard python
webserver tech (here, tornado), the result is a webserver running
on the driver's station that can read and control networktable values.
Now, we can connect a standard web browser to the server
and develop a custom dashboard build atop standard web technologies.

If you:
  * wonder why SendableChooser is so weird/flaky
  * were disappointed by the antiquated collection of interface
    elements available in SmartDashboard
  * were unwilling to invest precious time learning VFX/java GUI plugins

this approach may be for you.

To run the dashboard:

  1. make sure you have python installed (tested with both 3.6 and 2.7)
  2. make sure the correct python modules are installed (pynetworktables, pynetworktable2js)
  3. start dashboard server:  python DashboardServer.py
  4. point your favorite web browser to http://localhost:5080, Chrome is recommended.

Drop **a shortcut to** `start.bat` in the startup folder: `Win+R`, enter `shell:startup`.

Put a shortcut to Chrome there as well, and a shortcut to the driver
station.  The driver station shortcut has to be marked "Run as
Administrator" in its Properties window.  Also, disable UAC (the
window-dimming 'are you sure' thing) otherwise the dashboard won't start
up on boot.


### Programming Note

From the pynetworktables2js docs:

  NetworkTables is type sensitive, whereas Javascript is loosely typed.
  This function will not check the type of the value that you are trying
  to *put*, so you must be careful to only put the correct values (types) that are
  expected. If your robot tries to retrieve the value and it is an
  unexpected type, an exception will be thrown and your robot may crash.
  Make sure you test your code â€“ you have been warned.

### Helpful Links

[python](http://python.org) - is the language atop-which the dashboard
support resides.  

[pynetworktables](https://github.com/robotpy/pynetworktables) - is
the core technology.  You can use standard 'pip' mechanism to install
this module into your python interpreter:  'python -m pip install pynetworktables'

[pynetworktables2js](http://pynetworktables2js.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) -
is a small python module that forwards NetworkTables key/values over a Websocket,
so that you can easily write a Driver Station Dashboard for your robot in
HTML5 + JavaScript.  Included in the package are JavaScript utilities to
connect with the websocket.  Install via: 'python -m pip install pynetworktables2js'

[bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) - is a common / basic collection of
widgets and styling templates for website development.
